Here’s the transcript converted into markdown bullet points:

- **Introduction**
  - Andrew is welcomed on stage with applause.
  - He expresses excitement about being at Snowflake Build and shares his thoughts on AI's biggest opportunities.
  - Compares AI to electricity, emphasizing its general-purpose nature and transformative potential.

- **AI Stack Overview**
  - **Layers of the AI Stack:**
    - **Semiconductors**: The foundational layer.
    - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Including Snowflake.
    - **Foundation Models**: Trainers and models.
    - **Applications**: The layer generating the most value and revenue.
  - Media hype often focuses on the technology layers, but the application layer is where the real opportunities lie.

- **Trends in AI Development**
  - **Faster Machine Learning Model Development**:
    - Generative AI enables rapid prototyping and deployment.
    - Example: Sentiment analysis models that used to take months can now be built in days.
  - **Fast Experimentation**:
    - Teams can build multiple prototypes quickly and iterate based on results.
    - This approach reduces risk and accelerates innovation.
  - **Evaluations (Evals)**:
    - Evaluations are becoming a bottleneck in AI development.
    - Development workflows now involve building and collecting data in parallel rather than sequentially.
  - **Prototyping vs. Production**:
    - Prototyping has become much faster, but production deployment still requires time for robustness, reliability, and integration.

- **Move Fast and Be Responsible**
  - The mantra "move fast and break things" has evolved into "move fast and be responsible."
  - Teams can prototype quickly and test robustly without causing harm.

- **Agentic AI Workflows**
  - **Definition**:
    - Agentic AI workflows involve iterative, multi-step processes for generating outputs.
    - Example: Writing an essay involves outlining, researching, drafting, revising, and critiquing.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Agentic workflows deliver better results than zero-shot prompting.
    - Applications include legal document processing, healthcare diagnosis, and compliance.
  - **Design Patterns**:
    - **Reflection**: AI critiques and improves its own output.
    - **Tool Use**: AI makes API calls to perform tasks like web searches or code execution.
    - **Planning**: AI breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of actions.
    - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: AI simulates multiple agents working together to solve tasks.

- **Agentic Workflow Performance**
  - Benchmarks show significant improvements with agentic workflows.
  - Example: GPT-3.5 with agentic workflows outperforms GPT-4 in coding benchmarks.

- **Visual AI and Agentic Workflows**
  - **Multimodal Models**:
    - Agentic workflows can process images and videos more effectively.
    - Example: Counting players in a soccer game or identifying goals in a video.
  - **Demo**:
    - Andrew demonstrates a vision agent that processes visual data, generates code, and extracts metadata.
    - Applications include indexing video data and building searchable video libraries.

- **AI Trends to Watch**
  - **Faster Token Generation**:
    - Efforts to speed up text and image processing are underway.
  - **Tool Use in Large Language Models**:
    - Models are being tuned to support tool use, expanding their capabilities.
  - **Rising Importance of Data Engineering**:
    - Unstructured data (text, images, video) is becoming more valuable.
  - **Visual AI Revolution**:
    - Image and video processing capabilities are advancing, enabling new applications.

- **Conclusion**
  - It’s a great time to be a builder, with generative AI enabling faster experimentation and agentic AI expanding possibilities.
  - Visual AI is unlocking value from previously underutilized data.
  - Andrew invites the audience to try out the visual AI demos at [va.landing.ai](https://va.landing.ai).

- **Closing**
  - Andrew thanks the audience and welcomes Elsa back on stage.
