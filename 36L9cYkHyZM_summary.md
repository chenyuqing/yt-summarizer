Here’s the transcript converted into markdown bullet points:

- If you want to live in a creative way that benefits everything in your life:
  - Be a better person in your family.
  - Be better at starting a new business if you're an entrepreneur.
  - It’s all the same—it’s about striving for the best.

- Creativity is a way of looking at the world:
  - It’s about wanting the world to be the best it can be.
  - Doing whatever it takes to make it the best.
  - Being true to the idea that no one else knows everything—everyone’s ideas are as valuable as yours.

- We are all creators from the beginning:
  - I never thought the things I’m doing were possible or realistic.
  - I did things out of love, thinking my passion would be a hobby and I’d have a job to support it.
  - It magically turned out differently—the stars aligned, and things happened without me knowing it was possible.

- Sometimes things connect, and sometimes they don’t:
  - You can make two great things, and one connects with the world while the other doesn’t.
  - It might not be about the art itself—it could be timing, external factors, or just not being in the cards for that success.
  - All we can do is make something good, put it out, and hope for the best.

- Talent isn’t everything—work ethic matters:
  - Many talented people never make it because they lack the work ethic.
  - For some, work ethic trumps talent.

- Collaboration is key:
  - Real collaboration is when everyone works together for the best outcome.
  - It’s not about pushing your own idea—it’s about the best idea winning.
  - Personal quirks and imperfections make art great—your unique perspective is what makes you an artist.

- Stand-up comedy and art share similarities:
  - Derivative voices may find short-term success but don’t create lasting change.
  - The artists who change the world are often misunderstood at first but eventually gain lifelong fans.
  - You can’t second-guess your own taste to cater to others—it’s a bad way to approach art or music.

- Art is personal:
  - Push the boundaries of what’s personal to you.
  - People will resonate with it if they’re supposed to—it’s about the universe conspiring on your behalf.

- The magic of creativity:
  - It’s about catching waves that anyone can catch if they’re open to it.
  - Sometimes the ride happens, and it’s remarkable—it’s not preconceived but comes through the doing.
  - If you don’t act on an idea, someone else might—it’s about timing and the universe’s flow.

- The best artists have the best antenna for ideas:
  - They see the material that’s available and act on it.
  - The best comedians see the best jokes because they see the world differently.
  - Humor often comes from the unexpected—it’s about surprise and breaking assumptions.

- Collaboration with the universe:
  - We’re always collaborating with the universe by taking in information and vibing on it.
  - Pay attention to recommendations—if multiple people suggest something, it might be the universe telling you something.
  - Overhearing conversations or noticing phrases can spark ideas—these clues are everywhere if you’re open to them.

- Being open to the world:
  - When you’re open and looking for clues, they happen all the time, often right when you need them.
