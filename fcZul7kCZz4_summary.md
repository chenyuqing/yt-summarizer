# Selling AI Infrastructure in 2025: Key Insights

## Why Sell AI Infrastructure Over Single-Use AI Solutions?
- **Single-use AI workflows (e.g., content automation, cold outreach) are insufficient** for scaling businesses from $100K to $10M+.
- Businesses need **full AI infrastructures** to eliminate obstacles and drive transformation (e.g., revenue growth, efficiency).
- **Commoditization risk**: Selling single-use solutions (e.g., AI dialers, copywriting tools) leads to low differentiation and pricing pressure.
  - Example: A client shifted from charging $500-$1,000 per AI dialer implementation to selling a **$12,000 AI growth infrastructure** to real estate investors.

## Risks of Selling Single-Use AI Solutions
1. **Low Barrier to Entry**: 
   - Competitors can replicate solutions in 2-3 hours (e.g., AI tools for real estate agents).
2. **Competition from Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
   - Companies like Microsoft/OpenAI may release broad-use agents (e.g., for marketing, sales) at low costs or for free, rendering niche solutions obsolete.

## The Build and Release Model
- **Focus on bridging gaps**, not selling AI tools:
  - Example: A dental clinic client scaled to **$440K/week** by solving lead generation, nurturing, appointment booking, and closing gaps with AI.
- **Position as a one-time infrastructure build**:
  - Charge upfront (e.g., $7.5K-$15K) instead of monthly retainers.
  - Clients value long-term autonomy and ROI over recurring fees.

## Steps to Acquire Clients for AI Infrastructure
1. **Pick a niche**: Target businesses with strong product-market fit and capital (e.g., real estate, construction, dental clinics).
2. **Identify the gap**: Audit obstacles (e.g., lead quality, nurturing, closing).
3. **Create a Process-Selling VSL**: Highlight the gap and AI infrastructure solution.
4. **Drive traffic via Meta Ads**: Achieve low cost-per-lead (e.g., $20-$50 per booked call).
5. **Speed-to-lead**: Use AI setters to contact leads within 5 minutes.
6. **Sell upfront, not retainers**: Clients pay more for one-time solutions (e.g., $12K vs. $2K/month).

## When to Shift to AI Infrastructure?
- **Act now**: Early adopters capture 90% of profits during platform shifts (e.g., AI adoption).
- **Delayed entry** = lower margins due to increased competition.
